description: One might write continuously while he lived for or against socialism
  and yet at the end of a long and misspent life have said nothing that others had
  not said before him. Nevertheless, new generations come on and have to learn about
  Socialism as they learn about other things, for there always have been and always
  will be Socialists. This book does a good job at effectively demonstrating the flaws
  of the communist theory.
